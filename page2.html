			<h1>My Favorite Ted Talk I've Found On Youtube</h1>
			<p>This Ted Talk is about how we equate having a lot of options to having more freedom. This belief is deeply embedded in our society, yet research suggests it is the opposite. There are so many options to chose from nowadays, that we struggle a lot to chose correctly and we are never completely satisfied with the decisions we make. 
			This is something that I can personally relate to.  When there are too many options available, I can never seem to make up my mind on which one will be the best; and as Psychologist Barry Schwartz mentioned, I somehow feel worse about the decision I made. I truly recommend watching to this talk.
